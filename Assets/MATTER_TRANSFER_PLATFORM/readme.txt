TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

- When you open the file for the first time the mesh will be bright blue. This is normal. The Substance material is generating textures. After a few seconds the textures will appear.

- If while modifying the the input on your substance parameters and the mesh turns yellow, something has gone wrong with Substance. Check and then uncheck the "Generate all outputs" checkbox. This will force the Substance material to regenerate all of the textures and return it to functioning normally.

- Substance WILL make Unity crash from time to time. Save often. The best way to avoid this is to not try to modify input parameters while the "generating" text is displayed while Substance is processing.

- If the provided custom shaders look odd, it maybe because you are not in "linear" mode. You can set this in the Player Settings under : Edit > Project Settings > Player settings. If for some reason you can't run in linear mode you should use the default Unity Bumped Specular Material.

SOURCE TEXTURES:
----------------

2k versions of Baked Source textures are included with this asset for those who don't want to use Substance or are using a different shader setup such as Skyshop or Alloy.
